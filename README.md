Javascript: Password Generator 
<br>
<br>
Description
<br>
When you click the button to generate a password, a series of prompts are presented to create a new, secure password. 
<br>
A prompt is given to choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters. 
<br>
When prompted, you can select which criteria to include in the password.  
You can confirm whether or not to include, lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters.  
When each prompt is answered, input is validated and at least one character type will be selected or an error prompt pops up.
<br>
When all prompts are answered then a password is generated that matches the selected criteria.
<br>
When the password is generated then the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page.
